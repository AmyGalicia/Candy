        The first iphone was released on june 29 2007, you couldnt save much data and didnt have an app store. However you were able to access the internet and see the screen better which was an upgrade from the flip phone. Th is iphpne had a back camera, the quality of the camer was bad but having a camera in the first place was very huge.
