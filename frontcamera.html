        The iphone 4 was released on june 24 2010. This was the first phone to come out with the front-facing camera. Because of this feature we are all able to take selfies. Selfies are now a very popular way to take a picture and it is all becuase of the front facing camera that was added to the Iphone 4. You were able to store more memory and storage howver no where compared to what we have now
